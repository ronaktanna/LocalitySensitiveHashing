# LocalitySensitiveHashing
An implementation of Nearest Neighbor Search using Locality Sensitive Hashing for the L2 hash family.
The querying engine retrieves 't' similar images from the dataset given a query image (ID) from the in-memory data structure constructed using the random projections based approach of Locality Sensitive Hashing.

Dataset used: http://skuld.cs.umass.edu/traces/mmsys/2015/paper-5/ (devset: http://skuld.cs.umass.edu/traces/mmsys/2015/paper-5/devset/)
